# Anitag

A command line tool that renames mkv/mp4 files with proper anime titles.

Designed to work with MPV-Discord presence for accurate episode and anime metadata display.

## How to Use

1. Download to any directory
2. Add the directory to PATH
3. Run and hope it works :D

## example

cd into the directory with your files:
```
C:\Anime\Bloom into You> setAnimeTitle "Bloom into You"
Current directory: E:\Anime\Bloom into You
Setting Album name as: 'Bloom into You'

Proceed to update 13 files? (Y/N):
```

Press `Y` to proceed, `N` or anything else to cancel


## future goals

1. Bundle as an executable installer with automatic PATH setup
2. Potentially add torrent integration similar to DanDanPlayer
3. Build a dedicated UI for curated content filtering (my preference, most likely yuri)
4. More video format support? (most files are in mkv)
5. Faster renaming with MP4 format
6. Progress bar animation
7. ASCII art in the terminal while loading changes
